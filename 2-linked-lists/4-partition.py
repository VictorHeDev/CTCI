'''
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is
contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the
elements less than x. The partition element x can reappear anywhere in the
"right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and
right partitions.

EXAMPLE
INPUT:  3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
OUTPUT: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

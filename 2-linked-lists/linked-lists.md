# Linked Lists
### What is a Linked List?
Data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next and previous nodes.

Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. To find the Kth element in the linked list, you will need to iterate through K elements.

Adding and removing from the beginning of a linked list is constant time.

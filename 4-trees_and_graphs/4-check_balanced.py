'''
Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes
of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the
heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

APPROACH:
- recurse through the entire tree and for each node compute the heights of
each subtree
- if the heights of subtrees are different by > 1 then return early
